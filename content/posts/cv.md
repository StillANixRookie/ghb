## SKILLS

### CAD

> **SolidWorks & AutoCAD**

> →  For university, designing parts and profiles to be
> pro‐ duced via 3D printing, laser‐cutting, machining. For example flexible
> flippers, root and tip profiles of wire‐cut foam wings etc.

### Coding & Programming

> **Python**

> → Used at university, first for dedicated coding courses (drawing
> Bezier spline aerofoils) and then for other course‐ work where automated
> calculations become very useful (eg. Using Method of Characteristics to design
> a rocket engine nozzle).

> **C++**

> → Learnt through some basic Arduino programming. Plan to expand this
> knowledge by developing my own flight controller for a home‐made flying wing,
> and then maybe a quadcopter.

> that Linux was more appropriate for this, making simple bash scripting a
> necessity.

### Workshop 

> **Machining**

> ability. Learning to install & configure the i3 window man‐
> ager, and playing around with command line applications,
> has helped to make my workflow efficient, and to expand
> my coding knowledge. I plan on developing/maintaining
> my own website using ssh and markdown, but for now a
> github page will suffice.

> **RC Hobby**

> → Recently began building custom quadcopters, and plan
> to begin building RC aeroplanes, using a variety of manu‐
